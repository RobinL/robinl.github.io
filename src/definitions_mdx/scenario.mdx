A scenario defines a category of similarity for a subset of information in the input records, usually a column.

For example, for the first name column, the following scenarios may be defined:

- one or more side of the comparison is null
- exact match,
- jaro winkler match < 0.9
- everythign else

In Splink, these are known as a `comparison_levels` and each comparison level represents a branch of a SQL case expression. They are specified in order of evaluation, each with a sql_condition that represents the branch of a case expression",
