# Probabilistic record linkage

These pages present some introductory training material on probabilistic record linkage using the Fellegi Sunter model. Many of the articles are interactive.

This material presents a simplified version of the model used by [Splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink), a piece of probabalistic linkage software for which I'm lead developer.

Many of the graphics presented re-use Splink's graphical output, and the representation of model parameters used is the same as Splink's [settings object](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink_settings_editor/).
