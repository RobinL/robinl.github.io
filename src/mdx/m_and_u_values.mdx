# m and u probabilities in the Fellegi-Sunter model

The previous article showed how partial match weights are used to compute a prediction of whether two records match.

However, partial match weights are not estimated directly.  They are made up of two values known as the `m` and the `u` probabilities.

This article explains what these values are, and how they can help us interpret the partial match weights.

## Motivation and aim

Before looking at any maths, let's consider a simple example:

Imagine we have two records.  We're not sure whether they represent the same person.

Now we get some new information: we're told that month of birth matches.

Intuitively, it should now be around 12 times more likely that the records represent the same person.

This article explans how the `m` and `u` probabilities can be used to quantify this intuition.


## m and u probabilities

In the Fellegi Sunter model, ech partial match weight is derived from two parameters known as the `m` and `u` values of the model.
