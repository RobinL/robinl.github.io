# Why I’m backing Vega-Lite as our default tool for data visualisation

The range of data visualisation tools available to data scientists is vast¹. If they’re anything like me, beginner data scientists often don’t put too much thought into which tool to learn — and often just pick a tool on the basis of some impressive outputs they’ve seen online.

On any given team, there will tend to be a range of personal favourites. This inconsistency imposes a cost on the team in two ways:

* Data visualisation tools can take months to master, so a range of tools makes it harder to collaborate and share work, and harder to maintain codebases.

* Not all tools are equal. The quality of tools varies in their flexibility, the quality of their APIs, and the quality of the data visualisation they produce.

As a result, it makes sense for teams to spend time choosing a ‘sensible default’, and stick with it in most circumstances. I think Vega-Lite is the right choice for standardisation, for the following reasons²:

* **Consistent, disciplined API underpinned by well-designed grammar of graphics.** Data visualisation is the process of mapping different elements of a dataset to visual encodings such as positions on the x and y axes, colours, or sizes. I’ve never seen this more clearly expressed than in the Vega-Lite API. This makes the API extremely predictable, and easy to understand.

* **Founded on academic research.** Vega-Lite is a product of the[ UW Interactive Data Lab](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/), one of the leading academic centres for data visualisation. It’s heavily informed by research on visual perception and how to convey data visually as accurately as possible. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc1bq0qIKoA) is a great video intro to some of this research³.

* **Advanced interactivity.** Vega-Lite provides the most powerful declarative system I’ve seen for advanced interactivity between charts — such as [brushing one chart to filter the data displayed in another one](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/interactive_seattle_weather.html).

* **Language agnostic.** Vega-Lite charts are fully specified by a declarative .json based syntax. You can build Vega Lite charts by [writing raw json,](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/) from Python (using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)), from R (using the[ R interface to Altair](https://github.com/vegawidget/altair)), and from [Julia](https://github.com/fredo-dedup/VegaLite.jl).

* **[Looks great](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/)**. Good data visualisation can never be purely theoretical — an interesting visualisation which ‘breaks’ the rules can be more compelling than something more grounded in theory that looks boring or outdated. Vega-Lite [looks modern and slick](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) using the default settings, and is also [themable](https://beta.observablehq.com/@domoritz/vega-themes-demo).

* **Coherent ‘escape valves’ when Vega-Lite is not sufficiently flexible.** Visualisation libraries involve a trade off between flexibility and ease of use. With most libraries, there are some customisations or chart types which are simply not possible, and the user has to resort to a learning a completely different tool (e.g. d3.js) to achieve their goals. Vega-Lite is is part of a more coherent set of abstractions. Users can fall back on the more verbose, but more customisable Vega syntax when Vega-Lite is not sufficient, and Vega will be instantly familiar. And both Vega and Vega-Lite share a range of core concepts with d3.js (an imperative language), which gives essentially unlimited flexibility. Coming to Vega-Lite from d3.js, I found that it immediately ‘made sense’ because of these shared concepts.

* **Web-enabled by default, and easy to host.** It is trivial to embed [Vega-Lite into any website](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed), which can then be hosted on a static web host because data processing and interaction is all dealt with by the front-end. The ease of embedding charts has resulted in it being adopted within a number of high profile websites and tools, such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Graphs_and_charts#Vega) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/vega-graph.html). If you need to embed graphics elsewhere, you can convert them into a svg or [high resolution png.](https://vega.github.io/vega/usage/)

* **Vega-Lite charts are easy to incorporate into more complex webapps.** Vega View provides hooks so that Vega-Lite charts can be [modified by external events](https://beta.observablehq.com/@domoritz/reactive-vega-lite), and also means that charts can [expose events to other parts of the website](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/observing-vega-signals). This means that user interaction with a chart can drive the behaviour of other parts of your website.

* **GUIs and other spec generation tools.** [Voyager2](http://vega.github.io/voyager/) is visualisation recommendation tool which will allow the user to build specs using point-and-click, or will automatically build a range of Vega charts based on a dataset. [Draco](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/draco/) is a cutting edge visualisation recommendation tool that won the InfoVis 2018 Best Paper Award, that suggests specs based optimising ease of visual perception. [Lyra](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/lyra/) provide a GUI in which users can create heavily customised charts using point-and-click drawing tools.

* **Built into key data science tools by default.** A Vega-Lite viewer is built into Jupyterlab by default. Voyager can be installed into JupyterLab as an [extension](https://github.com/altair-viz/jupyterlab_voyager), enabling datasets to be opened in Voyager.** **Pandas dataframes can be extended to support [auto-generation of vega charts](https://github.com/jakevdp/pdvega). JupyterLab looks set to become the most popular development environment for data scientists, so Vega’s popularity looks set to continue growing.

* **Reactive dataflows and strong separation of concerns result in high performance.** Vega-Lite is underpinned by a sophisticated engine that is aware of what needs to be re-computed when inputs change or in reaction to other events. This eliminates unnecessary code execution. More generally, there is a strong separation of concerns between the specification and its evaluation, enabling iterative performance enhancement behind the scenes. More details are [here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@jheer/how-vega-works).

* **Free and open source.** You can find the main Vega-Lite codebase [here](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite).

## How to get started

The Vega-Lite docs have a good [getting started tutorial](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/tutorials/getting_started.html).

If you’re a Python user, I recommend Altair to write your Vega-Lite specs. Jake VanderPlas is the author of Altair, and ran an [excellent tutorial ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms29ZPUKxbU)at Pycon 2018.

For further details, the Vega-Lite team did a [great talk at OpenVis 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uaHRWj04D4&t=18s), and there is another more in depth talk by the team [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsrz4YdaZ_A).

Jupyter users who just want to get their feet wet can try [pdvega](https://github.com/altair-viz/pdvega).

### Endnotes

¹ For a sense of the scale of the landscape, see [here](https://github.com/rougier/python-visualization-landscape) for a graphic showing just the Python part.

² I have come to this conclusion after working with quite a wide range of highly-recommended (and very good) tools, including matplotlib, ggplot2, d3.js, highcharts, ggivs, Vega, Vega-Lite and plotly.

³ These influences run deep. The defaults built into vega-lite are carefully thought out, and grounded in research. For instance, how much does a typical data scientist think about which colour scales to use? This is actually the subject of[ rigorous academic studies](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2018-QuantitativeColor-CHI.pdf) — and the best ones are the defaults which are built into Vega-Lite.
