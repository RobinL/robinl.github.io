# The relationship between Partial Match Weights, Bayes Factors, and Probabilities

This chart shows how the partial match weights in a Splink `linker.match_weights_chart` (see [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/charts/match_weights_chart.html)) are related to Bayes Factors and probabilities.

<mark> Hover over the chart below to select a match weight. </mark>

    Caveat: the 'probability' is really only defined if a prior exists.  For the above chart, the prior is assumed to be 50%.
