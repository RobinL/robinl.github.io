# Splink and the Open Source Dividend

<Subtitle>
  How Splink has benefitted from the data linking community
</Subtitle>

## Summary

This post presents the argument for open sourcing analytical work using the real world example of Splink, a Python library for record linkage.  The hope is that it helps others who want to argue the case for open sourcing their work.

The benefits to Splink of working in the open have been enormous.   Academics, government, private sector consultancies, big tech companies and expert hobbiests have all contributed code and ideas to the project, for which we are very thankful.  As such, Splink represents an international collaboration of some of the world's leading experts in record linkage.

The following headline statistics give an indication of extent of external engagement and collaboration and the size of the community:

<ul>
  <li>Splink has been downloaded <span>{statistics.total_downloads.toLocaleString("en-GB")}</span> times</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/stargazers"><span>{statistics.total_stars}</span> people</a> have starred (favourited) Splink on Github </li>

  <li><span>{statistics.distinct_users_commented}</span> external users have posted a total of  <span>{statistics.total_external_comments}</span> comments on the <a href="http://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink">main Splink website</a>, including bug reports, feature requests and requests for help</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/graphs/contributors"><span>{statistics.code_contributors}</span>  users</a> have contributed to the codebase</li>

</ul>

This post it is a companion to a previous, more abstract blog post I've written:  [Why you should open source your analytical work](https://www.robinlinacre.com/open_sourcing_analytical_work/).






## Building a community

Some of the greatest benefits have come from the informal, virtual community centered around Splink, and the resultant network effects.  Each interaction within this community is a small quality and productivity multiplier, but these multipliers compound to make dramatic overall gains. We also seem to have established a virtuous cycle has been established whereby as the quality of the open source project increases, more users are attracted into the network.

The following charts illustrate the level of engagement we've had on Github:

<VegaLite spec={cumulative_external_comment_count} />

<VegaLite spec={distinct_external_commentors} />

With Splink, I believe working in the open was critical to establishing these network effects because:

- Our work on Splink was easily discoverable using Google, and the software and methodology was fully transparent because the source code is easily accessible
- Users could begin downloading and using Splink immediately and for free, without even needing to contact us - mostly, we only hear from them when they have problems or want to give us feedback
- Collaborators and other experts are motivated to help because they know they are contributing to something that benefits the wider data linkage community
- Discussions can be posted in the open, removing any barriers to communication

This community has been critical in helping us iteratively improve Splink. Users have spontanously given us hundreds of pieces of feedback, including reporting bugs, suggesting new features, and asking questions.  The first release of Splink was .  In early 2022, in response to two years of user feedback, we rewrote Splink from the ground up, addressing the most serious usability and performance issues which had been identified by the community.

## The growth of Splink

Let's start with a few charts that tell the story of the growth of Splink.

Right from the beginning - even when Splink was beta software - there was significant interest as measured by downloads.  As the project has matured, the number of monthly downloads has continued to increase consistently.

## Contributors

External contributors over time?

## Key collaborators

We have been invited to present to government statisticians in at least 6 different countries.  This has given us the opportunity to understand how record linkage experts in these various counties.

We have also presented our work to over 30 UK government departments and agencies, and had external contributions from several departments.

Finally, we've collaborated with data scientists working for private sector consultancies and big tech firms, who have contributed to our codebase.

Finally, in terms of usage we're aware of use of Splink in other government departments, in the private sector and academia.


## A final plea

The one area we don't have good statistics on is who is using Splink.  If you are a Splink user, please
