    title="Using DuckDB in ChatGPT Code Interpreter"
    date="2024-01-28"
    tags={["duckdb", "chatgpt", "tips"]}

You can use DuckDB in ChatGPT's code interpreter by providing this specific wheel file:

`duckdb-1.1.3-cp311-cp311-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl`

If you encounter any issues, you can ask ChatGPT to analsze a list of available wheels to determine the most compatible one for the environment.

Rob Allen says:
> I create a fair few scripts in my ~/bin/ directory to automate tasks. Since discovering [uv and inline script metadata](https://akrabat.com/defining-python-dependencies-at-the-top-of-the-file/), Iâ€™ve started using Python far more for these.

> As `~/bin` is on my path, I want to run the script by calling it directly on the command line. To do this, I use this shebang:

> #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script

The [ClickHouse obfuscator](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhouse-obfuscator) is a tool for anonymizing production data while preserving its key statistical properties. It maintains:

- Value cardinalities and distributions
- Data compression ratios
- String lengths and UTF-8 validity
- Time series continuity

    title="National Data Library thoughts"
    date="2024-01-16"
    tags={["data", "governance", "AI"]}

Three key priorities for building a National Data Library:

1. Data sharing and governance must come first - before any technical solutions. Success depends on data owners being convinced the NDL will make their lives easier, not harder.

2. Access permissions and management systems need to be rock-solid before building analytical capabilities. Get the foundations right.

3. Design for an AI-first future - by the time the NDL is delivered, most analysis will likely be AI-assisted. The architecture needs to anticipate this.

    title="Understanding DuckDB Connection Types in Python"
    date="2024-01-16"
    tags={["python", "duckdb", "database"]}
>
DuckDB offers special connection types in Python:

- `:memory:name` - Creates/connects to a named in-memory database that can be shared across connections
- `:default:` - Uses the default connection stored in the DuckDB module

Example:
```python
import duckdb

# Create table in default connection
duckdb.execute("CREATE TABLE tbl AS SELECT 42 as value")

# Access same table through explicit default connection
con = duckdb.connect(":default:")
con.sql("SELECT * FROM tbl")  # Works!

# Shared named memory connection
con3 = duckdb.connect(":memory:shared_db")
con4 = duckdb.connect(":memory:shared_db")  # Same database as con3
```

    title="Configuring Python Path Visibility in VS Code interactive window (Jupyter)"
    date="2024-01-16"
    tags={["vscode", "jupyter", "tips"]}
>
When working with Jupyter notebooks in VS Code, add these settings to your `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
    "jupyter.notebookFileRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "${workspaceFolder}"
    ]
}
```

Now, the interactive window will run any script as if it's running from the root directory even if it's nested
