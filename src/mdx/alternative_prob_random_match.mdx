# An alternative way to think about predicted probabilities in the Fellegi Sunter model

In the Fellegi Sunter model, the 'prior' is the probability that two records drawn at random (without replacement) are a match.

In our explanation of the Fellegi Sunter model, this is treated as the 'starting point' of the model, whereby we could be looking at an two records from all

$$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

possible comparisons of any record to any other record.

To compute the match probability, we observe information in the comparison (e.g. an exact match on first name), and update our beliefs using \textit{Bayesian conditioning}. For example, if we observe an exact match on first name, then we are no longer in the space of all

$$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

comparisons, and instead need to restrict our attention to the subset of all comparisons where first name matches. In this subset, the probability of a match is higher.

There is an alternative and equivalent way to think about the computation of the match probability that may be more intuitive:  Given a record, how likely is it that another different person has exists in the dataset with the same information?

To clarify, let's look at an example.  Suppose we have a dataset of 1,000 records.

$$\Large{p = \frac{2^{\omega}}{1 + 2^{\omega}}}$$
