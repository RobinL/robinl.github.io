# Live DuckDB WASM Splink model

Since it's possible to run [DuckDB WASM](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/overview.html) in the browser, I thought it would be fun to try and run a Splink model in the browser.  So I made a demo of a Vite app, code [here](https://github.com/RobinL/vite_splink_in_browser).

The app is in an iFrame below, and you can see the demo [here](https://www.robinlinacre.com/vite_splink_in_browser) in fullscreen.

Using [`vite-plugin-singlefile`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-singlefile) this entire app is bundled into a single `.html` file, so no webserver is needed to host it, a user can just double click it to open.  The only external dependency is the DuckDB WASM file, which is loaded from a CDN.
