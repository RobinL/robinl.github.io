# Two years of using LLMs: Thoughts, questions and

<Subtitle>LLMs</Subtitle>

This post contains some further thoughts and questions about LLMs, continuing from a post a year ago [LINK] that contained initial impressions.

It remains fairly disorganised, but I've written thoughts in three themes:

- My personal real world uses of LLMs to enhance my productivity

## LLMs as tools for individuals vs. organisations

I feel like we're in a very peculiar time for LLMs.  Myself, and many people I speak to from a range of professions claim to be using them individually to significantly boost their productivity.  I estimate I'm about 50% more productive, but I accept that's at the high end, because computer programming is one of their key strengths.

But I'm yet to see many big, compelling organisational-level use cases where the productivity of a whole company is measurably affected.

Is that because LLMs are most helpful with practice?

Or that different people find them helpful in different ways, and so it's hard to use them to provide a one-size-fits-all solution that helps even people who aren't interested in them?

I'm not sure, but I feel a strong sense of cognative dissonance around my personal experience with them, and the number of people who either ignore them or are outright sceptical of their value.

### Some organisational use cases that seem likely to

- LLMs as semantic search and summary across internal documents

### Reflecting on a year ago

Last year I wrote:

>  [Quote about information being filtered through LLMs]

We're starting to see this 'at scale' in tools like Apple Intelligence, Office 365 Copilot and gmail.
