# Two years of using LLMs: Current thoughts and reflections

<Link to="/thoughts/two_years_of_llms_initial_thoughts">
    Updating some initial impressions
</Link>

I've been usng LLMs intensely for two years now.  This post contains my current thoughts about their impact, around a year on from my <Link>previous post</Link>

## Summary

- I <Link>continue to think</Link> that knowlege workers will increasingly intermediate information through LLMs, rather than directly reading it.

- LLMs provide something of an all-purpose tool for knowledge workers.  Some killer 'universal applications' may emerge, but much of their value is in personalised, individual use cases that users tailor to their individual jobs and ways of working. As a result, it takes time and conscious effort for people to learn how to use them effectively.

- Whether [scaling is over](https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-diminishing-returns) or not, it's likely their coding ability will improve faster than general abilities, since there's such a close feedback loop.

- Over the past year there has been dramatic progress in the utility of LLMs to software developers, both in terms of the qualtity of models, and their integration with programming tools.  I see this trend continuing.  Increasingly the skill of software development will be mostly the ability to precisely describe the desired functionality, and to arbiter the quality of output. This actually changes the job of software development very little, except to increase the pace of delivery and reduce the necssary team size.

- I'm convinced that applications for education are transformative.  Software has forever promised to offer personalised learning experiences and underdelivered. Even in its current state, Open AI's Advanced Voice Mode often explains things better than I can to my 6 year old.



It remains fairly disorganised, but I've written thoughts in three themes:

- My personal real world uses of LLMs to enhance my productivity

## LLMs as tools for individuals vs. organisations

I feel like we're in a very peculiar time for LLMs.  Myself, and many people I speak to from a range of professions claim to be using them individually to significantly boost their productivity.  I estimate I'm about 50% more productive, but I accept that's at the high end, because computer programming is one of their key strengths.

But I'm yet to see many big, compelling organisational-level use cases where the productivity of a whole company is measurably affected.

Is that because LLMs are most helpful with practice?

Or that different people find them helpful in different ways, and so it's hard to use them to provide a one-size-fits-all solution that helps even people who aren't interested in them?

I'm not sure, but I feel a strong sense of cognative dissonance around my personal experience with them, and the number of people who either ignore them or are outright sceptical of their value.

### Some organisational use cases that seem likely to

- LLMs as semantic search and summary across internal documents

### Reflecting on a year ago

Last year I wrote:

>  [Quote about information being filtered through LLMs]

We're starting to see this 'at scale' in tools like Apple Intelligence, Office 365 Copilot and gmail.

### Some ways that LLMs may be used more effectively


People should start to curate knowledgebases of information specifically to be ingested by LLMs.  i.e. the canonical docs
