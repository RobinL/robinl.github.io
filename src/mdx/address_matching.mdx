# Building Accurate Address Matching Systems

<Subtitle>Feature engineering tricks to improve matching accuracy</Subtitle>

Address matching (geocoding) is a notoriously difficult problem due to the unpredictable characteristics of addresses.[^1].

Consider the example the following two matching addresses:

- 23A Marchant House, Jubilee Street, London, LO1 23D
- Flat A, Top Floor, Marchant House, 23 Jubilee Street, Fulham, LO1 23D

The above addresses exhibit far more variation than the following two non-matching addresses:

- Flat A 24 Jubilee Street, London, LO1 23D
- Flat A 25 Jubilee Street, London, LO1 23D

One of the most common record linkage approaches - known as the Fellegi-Sunter model - is not well suited to address matching because:
- there is correlation between different parts of an address, violating the statistical assumptions of the Fellegi-Sunter model
- the same address can be represented in multiple different ways, and it it almost impossible to parse any arbitrary address into a standardised/canonical form

To get the best accuracy in record linkage, we need a model that uses as much information from the input data as possible.

In this post, I share some tricks and techniques we can use to exploit the information in addresses as much as possible to maximise accuracy.  These tricks are used in my work-in-progress free and open source address matching library, [`uk_address_matcher`](https://github.com/RobinL/uk_address_matcher).

## Blocking stage

The purpose of blocking is to recover a list of candidate matches.
