# Partial Match Weights



In the previous article we saw that the Fellegi-Sunter model makes its predictions with a simple calculation: a sum of the partial match weights.

But what are partial match weights and where do they come from?

This article:

- Describes the concept of partial match weights
- Introduces the concept of m and u values, and how they determine of partial match weights
- Explains the relationship between m and u values, bayes factors, and probabilities
- Shows an example of how the model is computed for real data.

## Partial match weights

Some columns are more important than others to the calculation of overall match probability.  This is quantified by the partial match weights.

For example:

-  A match on date of birth provides stronger evidence in favour of a match than a match on gender.
-  A mismatch on date of birth may provide more evidence against a match than a mismatch on address (because people move house).

Positive values indicate evidence in favour of a match whilst negative values mean evidence against a match.

The concept applies more generally than just to matches and non-matches: partial match weights can be estimated for more subtle scenarios like 'first name not an exact match, but similar'.

It is up to the modeller to define these scenarios and the resultant partial match weights they wish to estimate.

### Example:  First name column

For first name, we could define the following three categories (in Splink, these are known as `ComparisonLevels`):

1. Exact match: First names are identical
2. Fuzzy match:  First names are similar according to the [Jaro Winkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance#Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_similarity) measure
3. All other cases

The estimated partial match weights may look like this:[^1]

[^1]:A later article will explain how to estimate partial match weights.  Here I just assume they have already been estimated.

<VegaLite spec={partial_match_weights_first_name} />

These are a series of mutually exclusive categories that work like a sequence of `if` statements:

```python
if first_name_l == first_name_r:
    partial_match_weight = 7.1
elif jaro_winkler_sim(first_name_l, first_name_r) >= 0.9:
    partial_match_weight = 5.7
else:
    partial_match_weight = -1.7
```

Observe that:
- An exact match on first name provides stronger evidence in favour of a match than a fuzzy match
- If the first name is completely different (neither and exact nor fuzzy match), this is evidence against the records being a match.

### Remaining columns

Separately, we will also estimate partial match weights for the surname column, the date of birth column and the gender column.

Note that the number of scienarios modelled and definition of the scenarios can vary depending on the type of information.

For example, since gender is a categorical variable we'd likely have two weights: match, and non-match.  For date of birth, we would may define three scenarios, but similarity would be defined differently to first name.

We can plot the partial match weights for all the information in a single chart:

<VegaLite spec={partial_match_weights} />

## Intuitive interpretations of partial match weights

In the chart, we can see that the partial match weight associated with an exact match on date of birth is stronger than the partial match weight associated with gender.

This should be intuitive: if we observe that gender matches in two records, this is not as strong evidence in favour of a match as observing that the date of birth matches.

Negative partial match weights can also be intuitive:  We may know that gender is recorded with a high degree of precision, but surname is commonly subject to typos or other errors.  In this case, we would expect a non-match on gender to provide stronger evidence against a match than a non-match on surname.

#### TODO:  Here we want a table with two records, that shows the partial match weights chart with highlighted bars, then a latex sum, and the waterfall chart.

The next article should be on m and u values
