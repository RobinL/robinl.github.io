I'm sensing a vibe shift since the release of Opus 4.5 that it's becoming acceptable for devs in serious teams to write their code using LLMs. I'm expecting 2026 to see at least one more jump in capability equivalent to Opus 4.5, and writing serious code primarily using LLMs to become mainstream. The open questions will be more about etiquette and less about use, see [here](https://www.robinlinacre.com/microblog/#using-ai-to-help-teammates-not-hinder-them)
