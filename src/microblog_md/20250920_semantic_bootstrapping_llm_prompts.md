A lot of the job of coding with LLMs is 'semantic bootstrapping': slowly narrowing down the prompt until it's precise enough to get what you want. I do this intentionally: start by getting it to write a simple script that approximates what you want, iterate, then put this in your context (e.g. `AGENTS.md`) as part of instructions to integrate this functionality into a larger codebase.
