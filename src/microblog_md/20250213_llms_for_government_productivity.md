I think the single most productivity-enhancing use of LLMs in government would be to give all government devs and data scientists access to Cursor (or similar). I am not yet convinced of the widespread value of 'behind the scenes' use cases of LLMs, but very bullish on skilled human-in-the-loop applications, especially coding.

Undoubtedly this situation will change as models improve, but at the moment there's usually not enough 9s of reliability to use in fully automated use cases.
