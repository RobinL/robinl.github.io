AI hypothetical: If you assigned a motivated person with an IQ of 200 to a random civil service position, would they be exceptionally productive, they were given all available recorded context?   I suspect the returns to intelligence would be relatively modest at the moment.

This seems quite relevant to question of how quickly can AI speed up progress in the short term.  At the moment, based on this sort of example, I tend to agree with the ideas of Ege Erdil and Tamay Besiroglu e.g. [here](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ege-tamay#:~:text=by%20better%20management%3F-,Ege%20Erdil%2001%3A31%3A05,-But%20that%E2%80%99s%20not) and Tyler Cowen [here](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/tyler-cowen-4).
