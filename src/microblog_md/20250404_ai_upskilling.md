I see too much focus on trying to find applications of LLMs to help other people 'at scale' with their jobs. At the moment, the output of LLMs is rarely useful for business rules or passive consumption. The lower hanging fruit is encouraging and helping people use AI directly, interactively, and however they see fit for their own jobs.

_Addendum 2025-04-07_: One thing in particular you want to avoid is giving LLM outputs to people who don't use LLMs.  I suspect this is why Apple Intelligence has done so badly thus far.  If your user is experienced with LLMs and is expecting it, it's fine to give them LLM outputs because they will treat them with the appropriate degree of scepticism.  Otherwise, they could be misled.
