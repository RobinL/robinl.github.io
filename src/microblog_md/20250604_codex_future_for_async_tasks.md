Codex feels like the future for a range of async tasks. Sitting back and watching it successfully prepare multiple small PRs to my website in parallel last night felt like a pretty big paradigm shift. It makes me want all my software (docs, sheets etc.) to have a textfile/diffable edit mode - and have something like codex be an agentic 'control centre' for a wide range of work. As it stands, this video is closest to how I think it's currently useful: https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/?video=1084810891
