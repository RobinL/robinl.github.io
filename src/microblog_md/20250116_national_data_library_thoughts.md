Three key priorities for building a National Data Library:

1. Data sharing and governance must come first - before any technical solutions. Success depends on data owners being convinced the NDL will make their lives easier, not harder.

2. Access permissions and management systems need to be rock-solid before building analytical capabilities. Get the foundations right.

3. Design for an AI-first future - by the time the NDL is delivered, most analysis will likely be AI-assisted. The architecture needs to anticipate this.
