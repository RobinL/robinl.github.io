A blocking rule in probabilistic record linkage is a criterion used to reduce the number of record pair comparisons in a dataset. It forms "blocks" by only comparing records that meet certain conditions, significantly lowering computational load and focusing on likely matches. For example, comparing records only if they share the same first and last names. The goal is high recall (capturing all matches), without much attention to precision (including non-matches), to efficiently narrow down potential matches for detailed comparison.
