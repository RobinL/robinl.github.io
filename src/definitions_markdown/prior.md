term: 'prior'
---

The 'prior' is a probability that represents our beliefs about the value of a parameter before we have seen any data.

In the context of record linkage models, it's often used to refer to our belief of the probability that two records picked at random from the input data will match.

In Splink, this parameter is called the `probability_two_random_records_match` in the settings object.
