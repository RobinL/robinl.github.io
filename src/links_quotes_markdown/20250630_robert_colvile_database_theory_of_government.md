> The vaccine passports debate is a perfect illustration of my new working theory: that the most important part of modern government, and its most important limitation, is database management. Please stick with me on this - it's much more interesting than it sounds. (1/?)

> Push it to the limit: Chris Smyth and Steve Swinford write in the Times' splash that about 5 million pensioners will get to keep the payment, while the other 5 million could have the payment recouped through their tax code. They hear that one option is to base the threshold test on the U.K.'s average post-tax income, which is currently around Â£37,000.
> Grave robbers: The Guardian's Pippa Crerar hears there are serious concerns this method will lead to HMRC collecting tax from bereaved families. She writes that there will likely be a six-month lag between the payment and the tax clawback, with thousands of pensioners statistically likely to die in this period. The paper splashes on her story.
> Why so complicated? Treasury boffins have struggled to find a way to means-test the payment beyond basing it on who gets pension credit (which is the current threshold). That's because of outdated computer systems and a lack of data within the government. As a result, the Treasury has had to resort to this more convoluted solution, which George Osborne also used to tighten eligibility for Child Benefit.
