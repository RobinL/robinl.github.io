> My favorite example of this is the work-to-rule strike. Where your employees go on strike by doing what you told them to do.
> And it turns out in almost every organization, unless it's doing a very simple thing, if your employees simply start following orders, your company grinds to a complete halt.
> Because it turns out that your orders are terrible, they have to be adapted to the local conditions.
> People are doing that all the time, very smoothly.
> And if they just start following the actual rules, nothing can be done.
> The whole system breaks.
