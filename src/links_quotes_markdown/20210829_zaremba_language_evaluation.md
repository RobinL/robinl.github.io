> One more exciting thing about the programs is that I said that in case of language, one of the troubles is even evaluating language. When the things are made up, you need somehow either a human to say that this doesn't make sense or so in case of program, there is one extra lever that we can actually execute programs and see what they evaluate to. So that process might be somewhat more automated in order to improve the qualities of generations.
