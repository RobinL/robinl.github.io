> Let me make it more concrete and less doomy: there exists a variety of systems in the world that have resolution paths built into the system, where those resolution paths guarantee a certain amount of human attention on behalf of the system to a person who attempts to engage the resolution path. And often what counts as "attempting to engage the resolution path" - there is a defined tripwire for that. And that defined tripwire might be writing a facially plausible letter.

And there is a number there. And based on that number, you have a certain number of people sitting in an office, reading facially plausible letters and engaging the resolution path.
