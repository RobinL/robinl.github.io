> Chat-driven programming. [...] It requires at least as much messing about to get value out of LLM chat as it does to learn to use a slide rule, with the added annoyance that it is a non-deterministic service that is regularly changing its behavior and user interface. Indeed, the long-term goal in my work is to replace the need for chat-driven programming, to bring the power of these models to a developer in a way that is not so off-putting. But as of now I am dedicated to approaching the problem incrementally, which means figuring out how to do best with what we have and improve it.
