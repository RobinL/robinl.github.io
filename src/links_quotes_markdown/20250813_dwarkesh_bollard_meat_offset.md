I think people will be assuming that what we're going to get up to is this push to make you vegetarian. I happen to have been vegetarian. I grew up a Hindu, so I've never eaten meat.

It's great when folks want to make a personal diet decision, whether that is eating less meat or meat from more humane sources, but the focus should not be on the individual. This is not how large-scale social change occurs. We need government reform. We need corporate reform. People can be a part of that regardless of what they eat, regardless of what their diet is. We need people to be advocates and funders and supporters of this cause.
