When you think about taste in ML, it’s the crucial ingredient that allows you to decide what goes into your large training run when you have imperfect information.</p>\n<p>We can study very deeply what the impact of an architectural change is, but past a certain level of scale, you have to guess whether the impact of that change will compound with others or conflict. You can’t test your full-scale run multiple times — you often have only one shot.</p>\n<p>So a lot of taste comes from being able to make good inferences about whether something will deliver increasing returns to scale. It’s also about judging whether a research direction is worth pursuing. Our baselines in ML are often so well-tuned that it’s very hard to beat them, even with theoretically better methods, because so many small tricks are required to make a machine learning method work, and they can fail for any number of reasons.</p>\n<p>It’s not like building a bridge, where you have a good idea why a particular shear was introduced. There can be all these quirks, and knowing whether to keep pushing in a given direction or abandon it for another is another aspect of taste.

It’s mostly about data availability and reinforcement learning signals. Take robotic locomotion, for example — robots’ ability to walk and balance. If you look at the latest videos from Unitree robots, the difference between now and two years ago is dramatic. They’re incredibly agile; there’s even a video where one gets kicked over and pops back up like something out of The Matrix.</p>\n<p>This progress is because locomotion provides a simple and strong reinforcement learning signal. It’s largely solved with basic RL now. Manipulation is harder, but I’m still optimistic about robotics for several reasons.</p>\n<p>First, I’ve seen remarkable progress from robotics labs this year — they can now handle fairly complex physical tasks. Second, there’s what I’d call a large generator–verifier gap. Improving language models requires finding humans who can outperform them, but in robotics we can use general models as teachers or judges. For example, if a robot is told to “stack the red block on top of the blue block,” a language model can evaluate whether it succeeded and provide a reward accordingly.</p>\n<p>Finally, for a long time people thought robotics required solving long-term coherence and planning, but language models have made that easier by breaking tasks into smaller steps. Most robotics labs are now focused on refining motor policies, and they’re making incredible progress.

Let's say you’ve got one rack and it's 1 megawatt. I'll leave the cooling to someone who specializes in air conditioners, but it's basically throwing air conditioners at the problem. Then you have batteries.</p>\n<p>So in order to get four nines of uptime on this… In South Texas, you actually need less than this. But let's just say it’s 24 hours worth of battery storage. That means it'll get you through two bad nights in a row, basically. Actually, it turns out that you can significantly decrease power consumption with a very small reduction in overall compute. So if you've got like three really bad days in a row or something, you can dial back your power usage quite a lot without compromising your inference or training.</p>\n<p>Okay, so you've got, say, a Tesla Megapack, something like four megawatt hours. So one megawatt rack, and then six Tesla Megapacks, each of which is roughly one truckload worth of stuff. So one truckload worth of rack, and then like six truckloads worth of batteries. Then in order to operate this at an average power of 1 megawatt, your solar arrays in Texas will be something like 25% utilization. So on average, if the sun came up every day and the day was the same length all the time, you would need 4 megawatts of solar arrays, which is about 4 acres of land. But in practice, because you're aiming for four nines instead of one nine, you need an overbuild of about 2.5x.

Now, the next scale is something that’s even bigger. And so Elon, just to stick on the topic, he’s building his own natural gas plant, like a proper one right next door. He’s deploying tons of Tesla Megapack batteries to make the power more smooth and all sorts of other things. He’s got industrial chillers to cool the water down because he’s water-cooling the chips.
